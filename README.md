- 👋 Hi, I’m @ussjoin, known elsewhere as Brendan Francis O'Connor. My main site is <https://ussjoin.com>.
- 👀 I’m interested in information security defined broadly---including resilience, policy, arms control, and human-centered design.
- 📻 I also do ham radio; see <https://k3qb.radio>.
- ⚖️ I'm also an attorney; generally, not yours, though I'm an ARRL Volunteer Counsel, and I can at least take an email if you think you have some specific reason you want to talk to me.
- 📫 How to reach me: bfo@ussjoin.com.
